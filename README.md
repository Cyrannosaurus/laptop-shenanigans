## Predicting the release date of the next mac mini release because I really like the price to performance of the M1 chip, surprisingly good for Apple, but would like more than 16gb of dedowated wam. Also, V2s are normally leaps and bounds better than V1 due to all the optimizations that couldn't make it in the first iteration. Anyhow, a shit linear regression birdie says August 2022. An even shittier one says it already happened in 2018.
### TODO:
- Prediction of macbook pro release date and macbook air release date and possible averaging. 
- A real way to remove outliers and not just human intervention

## Predicting LoL game outcomes (binary win lose) with just the info in the spectator API. Hardly even in a state that I would call a WIP.
### TODO:
- All of it
